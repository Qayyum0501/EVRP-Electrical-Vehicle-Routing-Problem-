Electrical Vehicle Routing Problem

Welcome to the reprisotory for Optimising the Electrical Vehicle Routing Problem EVRP),
focusing on a comparative analysis between diesel vans and electric vehicle (EVs)
in Thessaloniki, Greece. This project employs a Heuristic Genetic Algorithm (HGA)
to evaluate and optimise delivery routes, considering factors such as energy consumption,
travel costs, and charging requirements. 

By following the scripts and methodologues outlined in this repository, users can understand
the process of optimising delivery routes for EVs, considering real-world constraint
and laveraging advanced optimisation.
